Flow:

1. Start with information on air pollutants

2. Show information on AQI (optional, can be shown later also)

3. Load the city_day.csv data

4. Show basic info 

5. Define a function that shows a table of missing values

4. Impute missing values (optional)

5. Check Cities in Data and shortlist Cities that will be analyzed

6. Convert date column to datetime format

7. Combine Benzene, Toluene and Xylene into one column - BTX

8. Combine PM2.5 and PM10 into one column - PM

9. Create a 'Pollutants' column

10. Plot yearly data for pollutants

11. Plot yearly and monthly graphs for each pollutant (box plot, line plot)
