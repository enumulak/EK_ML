    "2. You can envision different inputs, outputs and edge cases for programs you write\n",

Since we access a list element once in every iteration, for a list size of 'N', we iterate 'N' times to locate the number that was queried. So, worst case scenario, Bob may have to turn all cards to determine the correct one. Suppose he is aloowed to turn 1 card per minute? It would then take 30 minutes to turn 30 cards. Could there be a better way to do it? Would it be possible to turn only 5 cards instead of 30?\n",

    "\n",
    "2. The 'space complexity' is some constant 'c' (independent of N), since we just need a single variable (position) to iterate through the array, and it occupies a constant space in the computer's memory\n",
    "\n",
    "Worst-Case complexity is often expressed using the Big-O notation. In Big-O, we drop fixed constants and lower powers of variables to capture the trend of the relationship between size of the input and complexity of the algorithm. For example, if the complexity of an algorithm is 'cN^3 + dN^2 + eN + f', then in Big-O notation it is expressed as **O(N^3)**\n",
