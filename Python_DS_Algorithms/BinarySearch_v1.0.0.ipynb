    "**Question 1:** Alice has some cards with numbers written on them. She arranges the cards in descending order, and lays them out\n",
    "face down in a sequence on a table. She challenges Bob to pick out the card containing a given number by turning over as few cards as possible. Write a function to help Bob locate the card\n",

    "A software developer or data scientist would normally not encounter programming problems in their day-to-day work, but such problems are commonly asked during technical interviews. Solving programming problems demonstrates the following traits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can think about a problem systematically and solve it systematically step-by-step\n",
    "2. You can envision different inputs, outputs and edge cases for programs you write\n",
    "3. You can communicate ideas clearly to co-workers and incorporate their suggestions\n",
    "4. Most importantly, you can convert your thoughts and ideas into working code that's also readable"

    "\n",
    "1. State the problem clearly. Identify input and output formats\n",
    "2. Come up with some example inputs and outputs. Try to over all edge cases\n",
    "3. Come up with a correct solution for the problem. State it in plain english\n",
    "4. Implement the solution and test it using example inputs. Fix bugs, if any\n",
    "5. Analyze the algorithm's complexity and identify inefficiencies, if any\n",
    "6. Apply the right technique to overcome the inefficiency. Repeat steps 3 & 6"

    "For the current problem, we can represent the sequence of cards as a list of numbers. Turning over a specific card is equivalent to accessing the value of the number at the corresponding position in the list\n",
